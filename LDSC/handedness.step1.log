Interpreting column names as follows:
Zscore:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
Weight:	Sample size
Allele2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
Allele1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ./HW5/ldsc_inputs/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from ./HW5/sumstats/Left_handedness.txt.gz into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 11774187 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 10569570 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 384 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1204233 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1204233 SNPs remain).
Removed 8578 SNPs with N < 137690.666667 (1195655 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 0.002, which seems sensible.
Removed 356 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1195299 SNPs remain).
