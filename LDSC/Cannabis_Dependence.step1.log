Interpreting column names as follows:
N_CAS:	Number of cases
N:	Sample size
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
N_CON:	Number of controls
Z:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ./HW5/ldsc_inputs/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from ./HW5/sumstats/Cannabis_Dependence.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 8957569 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 7784429 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 109 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1173031 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1173031 SNPs remain).
Removed 58261 SNPs with N < 249596.279881 (1114770 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 0.0, which seems sensible.
