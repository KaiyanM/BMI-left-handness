Interpreting column names as follows:
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
ALLELE0:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
ALLELE1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P_BOLT_LMM_INF:	p-Value
BETA:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ./HW5/ldsc_inputs/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from ./HW5/sumstats/Leisure_Computer_Use.gz into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 19400417 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 18181241 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 16892 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 444 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1201840 SNPs remain.
Removed 593 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1201247 SNPs remain).
Using N = 19400417.0
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 2.46895e-05, which seems sensible.
Removed 297 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1200950 SNPs remain).
Writing summary statistics for 1217311 SNPs (1200950 with nonmissing beta) to ./Leisure_Computer_Use.step1.sumstats.gz.
