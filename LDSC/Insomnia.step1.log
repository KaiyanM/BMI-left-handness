Interpreting column names as follows:
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
OR:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
RSID_UKB:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ./HW5/ldsc_inputs/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from ./HW5/sumstats/Insomnia_edit.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 12663596 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 11498431 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 458 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1164707 SNPs remain.
Removed 570 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1164137 SNPs remain).
Using N = 12663596.0
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 1.0, which seems sensible.
Removed 333 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1163804 SNPs remain).
Writing summary statistics for 1217311 SNPs (1163804 with nonmissing beta) to ./Insomnia.step1.sumstats.gz.
