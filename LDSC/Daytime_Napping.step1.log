Interpreting column names as follows:
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
EAF:	Allele frequency
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
BETA:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
N:	Sample size

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ./HW5/ldsc_inputs/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from ./HW5/sumstats/Daytime_Napping.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 13304132 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 12097736 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 10490 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 21899 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 203 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1173804 SNPs remain.
Removed 269 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1173535 SNPs remain).
Removed 0 SNPs with N < 301755.333333 (1173535 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was -1.4412e-05, which seems sensible.
Removed 137 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1173398 SNPs remain).
