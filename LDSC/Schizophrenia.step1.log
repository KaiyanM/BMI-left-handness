Call:

--out ./Schizophrenia.step1 \

Interpreting column names as follows:
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
PVAL:	p-Value
BETA:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
ID:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ./HW5/ldsc_inputs/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from ./HW5/sumstats/Schizophrenia.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 7659767 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 6477963 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1181804 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1181804 SNPs remain).
Using N = 7659767.0
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was -0.000500125041682, which seems sensible.
Removed 2 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1181802 SNPs remain).
Writing summary statistics for 1217311 SNPs (1181802 with nonmissing beta) to ./Schizophrenia.step1.sumstats.gz.
